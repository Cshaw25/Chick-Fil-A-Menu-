# Project Title - Chick-fil-A Menu Replica
## Description
This is a web development project replicating the Chick-fil-A menu using HTML and CSS, to demonstrate my web design skills and my ability to recreate real world designs. Down below you will find a screen recording of the project. Note that this is just the HTML and CSS files made for a bigger project, which will implement an order feature using Java Script.
